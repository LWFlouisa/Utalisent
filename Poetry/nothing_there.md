## NOTHING THERE

At night I drift<br />
by the headstone near.<br />
At night I drift<br />
hoping the cold will not give<br />
me fear, as I wait for<br />
sunlight in the morning light.<br />
At night I drift.

Rain overhead<br />
pours down on my face...<br />
the ghouls screetch.

I look and watch<br />
and yet nothing is there.<br />
I look and watch<br />
hoping it is a creature.<br />
There is only myst near<br />
by where I once slept tight.<br />
I look and watch.

The myst comes near,<br />
and almost envelopes.<br />
I black out fast.

In the morning, I gasp,<br />
for there was nothing there.
